"""Emit va_client phase messages from Pipecat speaking frames.

The Home Assistant Voice PE firmware (maxmaxme `va_client` component) drives its
LED ring, mic-streaming gate and a 7 s no-speech watchdog from `phase` JSON
messages sent by the backend:

    {"type": "phase", "value": "listening" | "thinking" | "replying" | "idle"}

Without these messages the device aborts each turn after the watchdog fires, so
emitting them is required (not just cosmetic). This processor maps Pipecat's
standard speaking frames onto those phases and forwards them to the device over
the websocket as TEXT frames.

Mapping:
    UserStartedSpeakingFrame  -> listening   (server VAD heard the user)
    UserStoppedSpeakingFrame  -> thinking    (generating a response)
    BotStartedSpeakingFrame   -> replying    (TTS audio is playing)
    BotStoppedSpeakingFrame   -> idle, but DEBOUNCED (see below)

IMPORTANT — idle debounce:
    OpenAI Realtime TTS arrives in segments (per sentence, and around tool
    calls), so BotStoppedSpeakingFrame fires several times *within a single
    reply*, with sub-second gaps before the next BotStartedSpeakingFrame. If we
    emitted "idle" on every BotStoppedSpeakingFrame the device's LED would flap
    replying -> idle -> replying mid-answer, and — because the firmware only
    arms the "stop" wake word during "replying" — the user would briefly lose
    the ability to interrupt. So we do NOT go idle immediately on BotStopped:
    we arm a short timer and only emit "idle" if no further bot/user speech
    starts before it elapses (i.e. the reply has truly finished). Any
    Bot/UserStartedSpeaking cancels the pending idle.

A barge-in mid-reply surfaces as a fresh UserStartedSpeakingFrame -> "listening"
(which cancels the pending idle); the firmware uses that to flush playback.

IMPORTANT — thinking watchdog + forced idle (v0.5.3):
    `thinking` is the one phase with no natural exit when a turn dies without
    a reply: a rate-limited / failed response.create produces no Bot frames,
    so the device blinks "thinking" forever WITH AN OPEN MIC (observed live
    2026-06-12: 44 s stuck, during which the mic picked up unrelated talking
    and the model answered it). Two defenses here:

    1. `force_idle(reason)` — the turn-death paths (ConnectionRecovery's
       rate-limit unstick + reconnect) call this INSTEAD of broadcasting idle
       around this processor, so the internal state stays consistent, AND it
       suppresses subsequent `thinking` emissions until real activity (user
       or bot speech) follows. Without the suppression, a VAD stop event
       already in flight re-emits `thinking` right after the unstick idle —
       the exact 400 ms race observed.
    2. A thinking watchdog — if `thinking` sees no model activity for
       THINKING_TIMEOUT_S it forces idle as a generic safety net (covers
       turn deaths that produce no ErrorFrame at all). While a tool call is
        in flight (tool handlers update this emitter's liveness signal through
       SafeRealtimeLLMService.register_function to tick it) the watchdog
       WAITS WITH NO CAP — explicit user decision 2026-06-12: a long web
       search on a hard question must get all the time it needs, the user
       knowingly waits. This cannot wait forever: every tool is bounded by
       its own client timeout (MCP ~30 s HTTP; web search the OpenAI
       client's 600 s default, whose except-path feeds the model a spoken
       error), and the wrapper's `finally` guarantees in_flight always
       drops back to 0 — after which the normal THINKING_TIMEOUT_S window
       applies again. If a slow-but-alive turn is ever cut off, the late
       reply still plays (BotStarted -> replying) — degraded but never stuck.
