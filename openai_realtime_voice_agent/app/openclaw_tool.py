"""Direct ask_openclaw tool: escalation to an external agent, bypassing HA MCP.

Why this exists: when ask_openclaw is exposed as an HA script through HA's MCP
server, every call is capped by HA core's hardcoded MCP request timeout
(homeassistant/components/mcp_server/http.py: TIMEOUT = 60). Deep tasks —
memory recall, contact lookups, multi-step agent turns — routinely take
longer, so the tool call dies while the real answer is still in flight
(observed live: "Buddy's number" answered by the agent at ~75s, discarded).

With OPENCLAW_URL set, the backend registers ask_openclaw natively and POSTs
{"question": ...} straight to the bridge endpoint ({"answer": ...} back),
with a timeout that actually matches agent latency. The same-named HA MCP
tool is skipped during tool assembly so the model sees exactly one. Unset,
everything falls back to the MCP-script path unchanged.

The speaker gate still applies: registration goes through
SafeRealtimeLLMService.register_function, so male_only_tools enforcement is
identical to the MCP path.
