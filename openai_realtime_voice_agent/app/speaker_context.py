"""Per-wake speaker context: voice-type (male/female) detection + shared state.

v1 of speaker identification for a two-person household with one male and one
female voice: on every wake, capture the first ~2.5 s of command audio, run the
pitch-based gender classifier (speaker_gender.py, pure numpy, off the event
loop), and hand the verdict to a callback that injects it into the OpenAI
Realtime session as a system conversation item. The current verdict is also
kept as module-visible state so tool gating (main.py register_function) can
enforce speaker-restricted tools no matter what the model tries.

Deliberately NOT biometric identity: a male guest classifies as the male
resident. Good enough for name-aware conversation and convenience gating;
upgrade path is swapping the classifier for enrolled voice prints without
touching the plumbing here.

Enabled only when both speaker names are configured (empty names = feature off,
zero overhead beyond an attribute check per audio frame).
