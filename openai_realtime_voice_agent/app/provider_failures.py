"""What kind of broken is this, and what is the useful answer?

An engine can fail in ways that mean very different things. Out of money is
permanent until someone pays; a dropped socket is over in a second. Answering
both the same way is how a house ends up either silent or paying on the wrong
account for a day.

The classes below are ordered by how sure we are. MONEY and AUTH are checked
first because their phrasings often also contain the words a transient error
uses -- OpenAI delivers a spent quota as a 429 that reads like a rate limit.

If an error message contains no recognized pattern, it is classified as TRANSIENT.
Unrecognized errors are far more likely to be a provider fault (a new error type,
a temporary condition, a backend rollout) than an app fault. Defaulting to retry
is safer than defaulting to silence. Empty messages (nothing to act on) remain APP.
