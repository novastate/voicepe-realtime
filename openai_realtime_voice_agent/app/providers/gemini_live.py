"""Google Gemini Live, wearing the same shape as the OpenAI session.

Proven against the live account 2026-09-08: all 52 tools accepted at once --
this add-on's 8 plus Home Assistant's 44 -- and the model picked search_home by
itself when asked about the car's battery, then answered in Swedish.

⛔ pipecat 0.0.97 defaults to models/gemini-2.0-flash-live-001, which the API
refuses with `1008 ... not supported for bidiGenerateContent`. Every live model
is a preview name and will be retired in turn, so the model is a setting and
this default is only the one that worked on the day it was written.

    The Voice PE is push-to-talk: it streams the microphone only during a turn
    and the follow-up window, so between conversations this add-on sends
    Google nothing at all. Google hangs up on a session it hears nothing from
    -- measured live 2026-09-09 at a very regular ~152 s of silence, with the
    server's own GoAway on the way out. pipecat reconnects in about half a
    second, and the reconnect is invisible to the user, so an idle hang-up is
    ordinary housekeeping for this device, not a failure.

    pipecat counts it as one anyway, and there is a bug in how it forgives
    them: `_check_and_reset_failure_counter` (which clears the count once a
    connection has stood for CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED_THRESHOLD seconds) is
    called only from inside the receive loop, when a message ARRIVES from the
    server. A silent connection delivers no messages, so on an idle device
    the reset never runs no matter how long the socket lived. Three idle
    hang-ups in a row -- about seven and a half quiet minutes -- reach
    MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES and are pushed as a fatal error. Observed
    2026-09-09 17:05:41: the engine died and the house had no voice until the
    add-on was restarted 45 minutes later.

    The rule pipecat already has is the right one; it just never gets a turn.
    Running it at the moment of failure -- when the connection's lifetime is
    known exactly -- is enough. A connection that stood for its threshold
    before dying is forgiven; three failures inside that window still go
    fatal, which is the case the counter exists for.

        exactly the case the OpenAI path has cleared since 2026-06-12. And a
        pause is indistinguishable from a dead client: this device is
        push-to-talk, so between conversations it simply stops sending, and
        Google hangs up (see this class's own docstring).
