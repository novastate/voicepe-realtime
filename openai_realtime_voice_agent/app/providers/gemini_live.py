    The Voice PE is push-to-talk: it streams the microphone only during a turn

    Google nothing at all. Google hangs up on a session it hears nothing from
    -- measured live 2026-09-09 at a very regular ~152 s of silence, with the
    server's own GoAway on the way out. pipecat reconnects in about half a
    second, and the reconnect is invisible to the user, so an idle hang-up is
    ordinary housekeeping for this device, not a failure.

    pipecat counts it as one anyway, and there is a bug in how it forgives
    them: `_check_and_reset_failure_counter` (which clears the count once a
    connection has stood for CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED_THRESHOLD seconds) is
    called only from inside the receive loop, when a message ARRIVES from the
    server. A silent connection delivers no messages, so on an idle device
    the reset never runs no matter how long the socket lived. Three idle
    hang-ups in a row -- about seven and a half quiet minutes -- reach
    MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES and are pushed as a fatal error. Observed
    2026-09-09 17:05:41: the engine died and the house had no voice until the
    add-on was restarted 45 minutes later.

    The rule pipecat already has is the right one; it just never gets a turn.
    Running it at the moment of failure -- when the connection's lifetime is
    known exactly -- is enough. A connection that stood for its threshold
    before dying is forgiven; three failures inside that window still go
    fatal, which is the case the counter exists for.
