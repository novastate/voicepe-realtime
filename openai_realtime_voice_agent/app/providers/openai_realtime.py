        """Reconnect WITHOUT forcing a response on the reconnected session.

        pipecat's reset_conversation() (used by ConnectionRecovery on a 60-min cap
        / keepalive drop) reconnects and leaves `_llm_needs_conversation_setup =
        True`. The collision: if a turn was mid-flight when the WS dropped,
        `_create_response()` had already set `_run_llm_when_api_session_ready =
        True` (because `_api_session_ready` went False on disconnect). After the
        reconnect, the `session.updated` handler sees that flag and fires
        `_create_response()` — but under semantic_vad (`create_response=true`) the
        SERVER also auto-creates a response for the user's next turn. Two
        response.create events collide → `conversation_already_has_active_response`,
        and that turn gets no answer (observed: first turn right after a reconnect
        fails, ~1 in 20 reconnects — whenever the user happens to speak in the few
        seconds just after a reconnect).

        Fix: after the normal reconnect, clear `_run_llm_when_api_session_ready` so
        the reconnected session does NOT self-create a response, and set
        `_llm_needs_conversation_setup = False` (same as the startup pre-seed) — the
        server-VAD drives every user-turn response, so we never need to create one
        ourselves on reconnect.

        CORRECTED (Task 9b fix round 1): this comment used to claim "the live
        context is untouched (it's restored by the SessionManager on the next
        real turn)". That was false, and remained false after Task 9b's first
        pass at this file — the SessionManager's restore path
        (ContextInitializer) only ever runs once, on a brand-new client
        WebSocket connection; it never re-fires for an in-place reconnect of
        this SAME service instance, because no new StartFrame is produced.
        Meanwhile `self._context` (this Python object) is untouched by
        reset — it still holds the full conversation up to the disconnect —
        but the FRESH OpenAI-side session this reconnect just opened knows
        NOTHING about it, and clearing `_llm_needs_conversation_setup` above
        stops `_create_response()`'s own lazy "send initial messages" loop
        from ever sending it either. Net effect before this fix: every
        60-minute session cap silently wiped the model's memory of the
        conversation. `_reseed_context_after_reset()` below re-sends
        `self._context`'s own messages onto the freshly reconnected session,
        the same way `ContextInitializer` seeds a brand-new one — using this
        service's own live context (more current than SessionManager's cache,
        which only snapshots on disconnect), not the SessionManager's cache.
        The actual send is deferred until the session confirms it's ready —
        see `_reseed_context_after_reset` and `_handle_evt_session_updated`.

        needed at all).

        Uses this service's OWN `_context` — the live, ongoing conversation
        pipecat has been tracking for this connection all along — not the
        SessionManager's cache (that cache is keyed by client_id for a
        brand-new WebSocket connection; this is an in-place reconnect of the
        same service, which the SessionManager never even sees). Tool calls
        are stripped first for the same reason `_strip_tool_plumbing` exists
        for the client-reconnect path: their ids belong to the conversation
        that just ended, and the fresh session rejects a replayed id. The
        result is capped by `_cap_restored_messages` at the same
        `MAX_CONTEXT_MESSAGES` setting SessionManager's client-reconnect
        restore uses (see that function's docstring) — this path fires on
        every 60-minute cap and every proactive refresh, so an uncapped
        conversation would otherwise grow without bound over a long day.

        FIX ROUND 2 (review): this used to send immediately once this method
        ran, i.e. as soon as `_connect()` (called by `super().reset_conversation()`)
        returned — which only means the websocket handshake finished, not
        that OpenAI's session is ready to accept `conversation.item.create`.
        If the server rejects something sent that early, it replies with an
        `error` event, and pipecat's `_receive_task_handler` treats EVERY
        unrecognised error as fatal (`_handle_evt_error(evt); return` — see
        that method's override below): the reader task dies, and the device
        is deaf until the NEXT reconnect. Not a lost memory — a dead
        session, every hour, to save one round trip.

        Fixed by mirroring the exact deferral pattern `_create_response()`
        already uses for the identical question ("is the session ready
        yet?"): `_api_session_ready` is the signal (set True by
        `_handle_evt_session_updated`, which fires once our OWN
        `session.update` — sent from `_handle_evt_session_created` in
        response to `session.created` — has round-tripped). If not ready
        yet, the prepared messages are stashed in
        `self._pending_reseed_messages` and sent later, from the
        `_handle_evt_session_updated` override below, once
        `_api_session_ready` is confirmed True — so the re-seed's
        `conversation.item.create`s always follow `session.update` being
        acknowledged on the same socket, never race ahead of it.

        Considered and rejected: hooking `_handle_evt_session_created`
        directly instead. `session.created` only proves the server accepted
        the TCP/TLS handshake and is about to read our settings — it says
        nothing about whether the settings we're about to send (and the
        conversation.item.create calls after them) will be accepted.
        `_api_session_ready` is the strictly later, already-proven-safe
        point `_create_response()` itself insists on for the same class of
        send, so this reuses that guarantee rather than a weaker one.

        Failure mode considered: if the socket dies AGAIN before
        `session.updated` ever arrives (e.g. the settings themselves are
        rejected), `_pending_reseed_messages` is simply left set and never
        sent for THIS attempt — but `_receive_task_handler`'s override
        below already turns that death into a fresh `ConnectionRecovery`
        reconnect trigger, and the NEXT `reset_conversation()` call
        recomputes `_pending_reseed_messages` from `self._context` (still
        intact) and overwrites the stale one before it could ever be acted
        on. No permanently-lost re-seed; at worst one retried cycle.
