"""Voice enrollment: guided, on-device capture of a household member's voice.

Broader goal than wake words: one guided session per person yields (a) real
wake-phrase positives for microWakeWord retraining, and (b) natural-speech
audio suitable for voice-print (speaker-ID) enrollment later. The user starts
it by voice ("I want to teach you my voice"); the model calls the
voice_enrollment tool and then FOLLOWS THE SCRIPT the tool returns, keeping the
conversation loop alive turn by turn while this recorder dumps every inbound
mic frame to a WAV.

Files land in /share/voice-enrollment/<person>_<timestamp>.wav (16 kHz mono
PCM16). /share persists across add-on rebuilds and is reachable from the HA
host, from where recordings are pulled into the household's private sample
store. THESE ARE PERSONAL DATA: never commit them to a repo.
