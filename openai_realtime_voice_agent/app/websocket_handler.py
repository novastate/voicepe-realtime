# transport does NOT resample (only the OUTPUT transport does), and OpenAI

# Gemini Live has no such lock -- it takes the device's native 16 kHz, so its
# declared input rate is app.providers.input_sample_rate("gemini") instead of

    cap, 1006, or any send/receive failure) it treats the send error as fatal and

    persistent session is then dead until the add-on restarts, so the device gets
    no answer to any further turn (observed live: a 1011 flood after which the
    next question got silence).

    This processor watches the ErrorFrames as they travel upstream to the task
    source, and on the first connection-death signature it:
      1. emits `idle` to the device so it unsticks (LED + mic reset), and

         rebuild: the running pipeline keeps the same service object, which is

    UserStoppedSpeakingFrame ourselves" as blocking -- it isn't, because we
    don't need to hook it: the service already hooks its own
    UserStoppedSpeakingFrame handling on every real turn. Setting
    `_needs_turn_complete_message = True` is a plain instance-attribute write
    (grep of the whole file: `_needs_turn_complete_message` appears at exactly
    these three sites -- init, this setter, that one checker/resetter -- so
    there is nothing else to coordinate with or race against). No subclassing,
    no monkeypatching, no new dispatch logic: the existing, live-running code
    does the closing call for us the next time the user's real speech ends.

    THE ONE REAL COST (say it plainly, not leave it to be discovered): the
    note is not spoken about the instant a voice is recognised -- it is
    folded into the model's awareness only when the CURRENT (or, if the probe
    fires after the user already stopped talking this turn, the NEXT) user
    turn completes and the model responds to it. That is the same
    "may not land until a later turn" characteristic this feature has always
    had on OpenAI (see the wiring comment below) -- just one turn-boundary
    later on Gemini, and never audible on its own.

    Structural guard: if a future pipecat renames or removes
    `_needs_turn_complete_message`, silently doing nothing here would be
    exactly the failure mode this whole task exists to end. So existence is
    checked explicitly and logged as an ERROR (not folded into the general
    try/except below) if missing, and the injection is skipped rather than
    guessed at.

        # authoritative on the cloud side too, in two layers:

        #      audio (the device closed its own mic gate in the same instant),
        #      so in the common case no turn is created at all;
        #   2) if the server VAD committed BEFORE our clear landed (tight race),
        #      OpenAI creates a response moments later anyway — so any assistant
        #      conversation item that appears within INTERRUPT_KILL_WINDOW_S of
        #      a device interrupt is cancelled on arrival (handler below). A
        #      legitimate next turn cannot fall inside that window: after a stop
        #      the mic is closed, and a fresh wake-word turn needs the chime +
