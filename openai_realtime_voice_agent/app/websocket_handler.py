# declared input rate is app.providers.input_sample_rate("gemini") instead of

    pipecat 0.0.97's OpenAIRealtimeLLMService has NO reconnect logic: when the
    OpenAI WS drops (1011 keepalive ping timeout, 1001 going away on the 60-min
    cap, 1006, or any send/receive failure) it treats the send error as fatal and
    floods ErrorFrame — ~15/s, one per forwarded mic frame — forever. The single
    persistent session is then dead until the add-on restarts, so the device gets
    no answer to any further turn (observed live: a 1011 flood after which the
    next question got silence). Gemini's service is the opposite: it has its own
    `_reconnect`, `_handle_connection_error` and session resumption, so calling
    `reset_conversation` on it would just be a second hand fighting the first.

    This processor watches the ErrorFrames as they travel upstream to the task
    source and hands every one of them to `handle_error`, which asks two
    SEPARATE questions (see its docstring): does the router need to hear about
    this (`app.provider_failures.classify`, `app.provider_router.ProviderRouter`
    — this is what lets a money/auth failure fail the connection over even
    though nothing here can repair it), and is OUR connection specifically
    dead enough that repairing it is worth doing. Only the second question can
    lead to:
      3. repairing this engine's session in place — emit `idle` to unstick the
         device (LED + mic reset) and call service.reset_conversation() — the
         one PUBLIC method that does _disconnect() + _connect() + re-sends the
         session config (instructions, tools, turn detection). No pipeline
         rebuild: the running pipeline keeps the same service object, which is
         exactly the one reset_conversation reconnects.
    Answering "no" to both (our own tool's fault, an engine that heals itself,
    a rate limit, anything else that isn't a dead socket) means doing nothing
    but the plain idle-unstick below. A guard + cooldown collapse an error
    flood into a single report/reconnect attempt, retrying at most every
    RECONNECT_COOLDOWN_S while the link stays down.

    don't need to hook it: the service already hooks its own
    UserStoppedSpeakingFrame handling on every real turn. Setting

    these three sites -- init, this setter, that one checker/resetter -- so
    there is nothing else to coordinate with or race against). No subclassing,
    no monkeypatching, no new dispatch logic: the existing, live-running code
    does the closing call for us the next time the user's real speech ends.

    THE ONE REAL COST (say it plainly, not leave it to be discovered): the
    note is not spoken about the instant a voice is recognised -- it is
    folded into the model's awareness only when the CURRENT (or, if the probe
    fires after the user already stopped talking this turn, the NEXT) user
    turn completes and the model responds to it. That is the same
    "may not land until a later turn" characteristic this feature has always
    had on OpenAI (see the wiring comment below) -- just one turn-boundary
    later on Gemini, and never audible on its own.

    Structural guard: if a future pipecat renames or removes
    `_needs_turn_complete_message`, silently doing nothing here would be
    exactly the failure mode this whole task exists to end. So existence is
    checked explicitly and logged as an ERROR (not folded into the general

    FIX ROUND 1 found that pushing a frame through `context_aggregator.user()`
    never reaches either engine (push_frame forwards to `self._next`, past the
    aggregator's own dispatch; neither service's process_frame acts on
    LLMMessagesUpdateFrame anyway). OpenAI got its original direct
    `send_client_event` back; Gemini was routed through `LLMMessagesAppendFrame`
    -> `GeminiLiveLLMService._create_single_response`, which works -- but that
    method hardcodes `turn_complete=True`, so Gemini spoke an unprompted reply
    every single time a voice was recognised. Worse than the silent loss this
    task exists to fix.

    FIX ROUND 2 concluded no silent channel existed for Gemini and shipped a
    warn-and-skip instead. FIX ROUND 3 found that conclusion was wrong -- see
    `_send_gemini_note_silently`'s docstring for the bridge that makes
    `send_client_content(turn_complete=False)` actually reach the model
    without an unprompted reply.

    `probe` is the connection's SpeakerProbe; it is only read by verdict_text
    for the "not confidently matched" fallback message (to name the household
    members it might be), so tests exercising just the confident-match branch
    can omit it.

        #      audio (the device closed its own mic gate in the same instant),
        #      so in the common case no turn is created at all;
        #   2) if the server VAD committed BEFORE our clear landed (tight race),

        #      conversation item that appears within INTERRUPT_KILL_WINDOW_S of

        which cannot be written must never stop a conversation, and an
        awaited publish sitting in front of create_transport would make a
        slow or unreachable supervisor delay every new connection by up to
        the httpx timeout. Wrapping the call in its own try/except -- rather
        than relying on asyncio's default "Task exception was never
        retrieved" handling -- means a failure here is still logged, just
        never blocking.

        The `finally` clears `connection.provider_status_task` once this is
        actually done, so nothing keeps a finished task referenced forever;
        the identity check is so a second connection's (never possible here,
        since each connection gets its own task, but cheap insurance) or a
        stale reference can't be cleared out from under a newer one.
