"""Play something by name, using Music Assistant's own search.

Home Assistant's HassMediaSearchAndPlay searches every provider at once and
ranks the results itself. Ask for "P3" -- a national radio station -- and it
starts a Spotify track called "Knæklys", because a track happened to score
higher than a station. Nothing in the tool lets the assistant say "I mean the
radio station".

Music Assistant can. `music_assistant.search` takes a media_type filter and
returns one bucket per kind, across every provider the house has connected
(the local library, Spotify, TuneIn, Radio Browser, iTunes podcasts). So the
model names the kind of thing it wants and gets that kind. Verified live:

    search "P3"    type=radio    -> 'P3' (tunein), 'Sveriges Radio P3' (library)
    search "Kent"  type=artist   -> 'Kent' (library), 'kent' (spotify)
    search "chill" type=playlist -> 'Chill-mix' (spotify)

Then `music_assistant.play_media` plays the winning uri on a chosen player.

Everything here is a local REST call through the supervisor proxy, the same way
search_home_tool reads states.
