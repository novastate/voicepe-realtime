# Configuration Reference

Two places hold configuration:

- **The add-on** — the Configuration tab in Home Assistant. Options are grouped:
  🔑 Basics → 🗣️ Model & voice → 💬 Conversation → 🌐 Web search → 🎚️ Audio →
  🏠 Home Assistant → ⚙️ Advanced → 🔍 Debug. Every option has inline help.
- **The firmware** — substitutions in your per-device stub in ESPHome Builder.

> The add-on UI renders every text option as a single-line input. For long text like
> `instructions`, use the Configuration tab's **⋮ → Edit in YAML** for a real editor.

> The `*_custom` fields and the legacy `server_vad` fields are hidden until you toggle
> **"Show unused optional configuration options"** at the bottom of the tab.

## 🔑 Basics

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `openai_api_key` | *(empty)* | Your OpenAI key (`sk-...`), created at platform.openai.com with billing enabled. Everything — listening, thinking, speaking, web search — runs on this key. **Required.** |
| `instructions` | English voice-tuned prompt | The system prompt: personality, language, house rules. Write it like you'd brief a person. See [Persona & voices](features.md#persona--voices) for what it can and can't change. |
| `transcription_language` | *(empty)* | Two-letter ISO code (`en`, `nl`, `de`, …). Setting it pins the language and logs what you said as `🗣️ user:` lines — very handy for debugging. Empty = auto-detect, no user transcript. |

## 🗣️ Model & voice

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `openai_model` | `gpt-realtime-2` | The speech-to-speech model. Choices: `gpt-realtime-2` (newest, smartest), `gpt-realtime-1.5`, `gpt-realtime-mini` (cheaper, less capable), `gpt-realtime`, or `custom`. |
| `openai_model_custom` | *(hidden)* | Any valid Realtime model id, used when `openai_model` is `custom`. Expert escape hatch. |
| `openai_voice` | `marin` | The voice it speaks with. `marin`/`cedar` are the newest and most natural; also `alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `sage`, `shimmer`, `verse`. Restart the add-on after changing — a running conversation keeps its voice. |
| `openai_voice_custom` | *(hidden)* | Any valid OpenAI voice name, used when `openai_voice` is `custom`. |
| `openai_speed` | `1.0` | Speaking pace, `0.25`–`1.5`. Changes pace only, not the words. |
| `max_output_tokens` | `0` | Caps answer length in tokens (≈ 0.75 words each). `0` = no cap. Set ~`1024` if it rambles; too low cuts answers off mid-sentence. |

## 💬 Conversation

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `follow_up_listen_seconds` | `8` | How long the mic stays open after each reply, so you can keep talking without the wake word. `0` disables follow-ups. |
| `follow_up_open_delay_ms` | `700` | Echo guard: pause between the end of a reply and the mic re-opening, so the speaker's tail can't become a ghost question. Lower (300–500) is snappier but risks the assistant answering its own echo — raise it back if it "answers nobody" or repeats itself. |
| `wake_open_delay_ms` | `700` | The same echo guard after the wake chime, before the mic opens. Lower for a snappier wake; raise if a wake sometimes triggers an answer to nothing. |
| `vad_eagerness` | `low` | How quickly it decides you're done talking. `low` waits patiently (best if you pause mid-sentence), `high` answers faster but may cut you off, `auto` lets OpenAI decide. |
| `phase_idle_debounce_ms` | `1500` | How long the assistant must stay silent before the device counts the answer as finished. Bridges pauses between sentences so the LED and "stop" keep working through long answers. Raise if the device flips to idle mid-answer. |

## 🌐 Web search

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_web_search` | `true` | Online lookups (weather, news, facts). Each lookup is one extra OpenAI call on your key (a few cents) and adds ~1–3 s. Set `false` to disable. |
| `web_search_model` | `gpt-5.5` | The model that searches and summarises. `gpt-5.5` is best quality; `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5`, mini and nano variants are cheaper but miss more. |
| `web_search_model_custom` | *(hidden)* | Any model supporting OpenAI's `web_search` tool, when set to `custom`. |

## 🎚️ Audio

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `playback_prebuffer_ms` | `150` | How much of the answer to buffer before playing — absorbs Wi-Fi jitter (the start-of-reply crackle) at the cost of that much reply latency. Raise to ~250 if you hear crackle; `0` = play immediately. |
| `noise_reduction` | `off` | Extra input filtering before OpenAI. Usually leave `off` — the device's XMOS chip already filters. Try `near_field` (talking close) or `far_field` (across the room) if it mishears in noise. |

## 🏠 Home Assistant & speakers

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `speaker_male_name` | *(empty)* | Name to use when a male voice is detected. Leave both name fields empty to disable speaker detection. |
| `speaker_female_name` | *(empty)* | Name to use when a female voice is detected. |
| `male_only_tools` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated tool names that only execute for the male voice. Enforced below the model — it can't be talked around. Convenience gating, not biometric security. |
| `wake_sound_entity` | *(empty)* | The device's wake-chime switch entity. When set, the chime is auto-muted during enrollment sessions so the coach's instructions stay audible. |
| `timer_ring_entity` | *(empty)* | The exposed `switch.<device>_timer_ringing` entity for the physical timer bell. Empty = voice timers unavailable (the assistant will say so). One add-on instance has one bell entity; timer speech still returns to the device that created the timer. |
| `instance_name` | *(empty)* | Sensor prefix, e.g. `kitchen` → `sensor.voicepe_kitchen_*`. Also sent to your agent as the `room` for report-backs. Empty = `device`. |
| `enrollment_phrase` | `hey jarvis` | The wake phrase the enrollment coach asks you to repeat. **Set this to the wake word you actually use / plan to train.** |
| `enrollment_tts_voice` | `fable` | The voice of the enrollment coach (any OpenAI `/v1/audio/speech` voice). |
| `ha_mcp_url` | *(empty)* | Leave empty (recommended): uses HA's built-in MCP Server integration. Only set a URL if you run the separate ha-mcp add-on. |
| `longlived_token` | *(empty)* | Leave empty (recommended): the add-on uses its own supervisor permission. Only paste a long-lived token (HA profile → Security) if startup logs a 401/403 on `/core/api/mcp`. |
| `mcp_tool_allowlist` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated whitelist of MCP tool names; empty = all. The built-in server's set is already small; mainly useful with ha-mcp (80+ tools) to keep sessions fast and cheap. |
| `openclaw_url` | *(empty)* | Direct endpoint of your agent bridge. Enables the `ask_openclaw` escalation tool (called directly, ~2.5-minute budget, bypassing HA MCP's 60 s cap) and the instant `recall_memory` tool. Contract in [Agent Integration](agent-integration.md). |
| `announce_port` | `0` | Port for the announce endpoint — a LAN route back to the device so an agent can speak in the room. Enabled only when **both** this and `announce_token` are set. |
| `announce_token` | *(empty)* | Bearer token for the announce endpoint. The add-on runs on the host network, so the token is the lock — generate a long random one. |

## ⚙️ Advanced

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `websocket_port` | `8080` | The port Voice PE devices connect to. Must match each device's `va_url` in its firmware. One add-on instance accepts multiple devices on this port; change it only on a port clash. `8081` is used by dev builds. |

The add-on is intended for a trusted home LAN. A device's `device_id` routes its
session and is not an authentication credential; do not expose `websocket_port`
outside that network.
| `session_reuse_timeout_seconds` | `300` | If the device reconnects within this window (Wi-Fi blip, add-on restart), the conversation resumes where it left off. `0` = always start fresh. |
| `max_context_messages` | `12` | How many recent exchanges the session keeps. More = better in-conversation memory, but every answer re-bills the whole history — long chats get expensive and can hit rate limits. `0` = unlimited. |
| `transcription_model` | `gpt-4o-transcribe` | Writes your speech into the log when `transcription_language` is set. Does **not** affect understanding — the main model hears your audio natively. Also: `gpt-live-transcribe` (low-latency live transcription), `gpt-transcribe` (completed audio), `gpt-realtime-whisper`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `whisper-1`. |
| `transcription_model_custom` | *(hidden)* | Custom transcription model id. |
| `turn_detection_type` | *(unset)* | Leave unset: `semantic_vad` (understands when your sentence is finished) is the hardwired default. `server_vad` is the legacy silence-timer method, kept as an escape hatch, tuned by the three fields below. |
| `vad_threshold` | *(unset)* | server_vad only: loudness to count as speech, 0–1 (default 0.5). Higher = fewer false triggers from background noise. |
| `vad_prefix_padding_ms` | *(unset)* | server_vad only: audio kept from just before speech was detected so your first word isn't clipped (default 300). |
| `vad_silence_duration_ms` | *(unset)* | server_vad only: how long a silence ends your turn (default 800). Raise if you get cut off while pausing. |

## 🔍 Debug

| Option | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_recording` | `false` | Saves mic and speaker audio to files inside the add-on, for troubleshooting only. Also saves speaker-probe captures for offline threshold calibration. Leave off normally. |

---

## Firmware substitutions

Set these in your per-device stub in ESPHome Builder (the stub overrides the
firmware's defaults). The secrets (`wifi_ssid`, `wifi_password`, `ota_password`,
`api_key`) are passed as substitutions because a remote package can't use
`!secret` directly.

| Substitution | Default | Purpose / when to change |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `home-assistant-voice` | The device's ESPHome name. **Keep it stable** across re-flashes of an adopted device. |
| `friendly_name` | `Home Assistant Voice` | Display name in Home Assistant. |
| `wifi_ssid` / `wifi_password` | *(from secrets)* | Your Wi-Fi credentials. |
| `ota_password` | *(from secrets)* | Protects over-the-air flashes. Use the one ESPHome generated at adopt time (or pick one on a fresh flash). |
| `api_key` | *(from secrets)* | ESPHome Noise/API encryption key — 32 random bytes, base64 (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Not an HA token, not your OpenAI key. |
| `va_url` | `ws://homeassistant.local:8080/` | WebSocket endpoint of the backend add-on. Change if your HA host has a different name/IP or the add-on uses another port, e.g. `ws://192.168.1.x:8082/`. No auth token — it's a LAN-local service. |
| `wake_word_model` | `models/hey_leonard.json` (this repo) | The microWakeWord model URL. Point it at your own trained model, or at a stock model. Runtime switching between the built-in options needs no reflash — use the "Wake word" dropdown in HA. |
| `default_wake_word` | `Hey Leonard` | Which entry of the HA "Wake word" dropdown is selected on first boot (`Hey Leonard`, `Hey Jarvis`, `Okay Nabu`). |
| `wake_cutoff_slight` / `wake_cutoff_moderate` / `wake_cutoff_very` | `217` / `178` / `140` | The three sensitivity tiers of the HA "Wake word sensitivity" select, as quantized uint8 probability cutoffs (`round(p × 255)`; **lower = more sensitive** = more false accepts). Custom-trained models ship calibrated values — override these with your model's calibration. |
| `hidden_ssid` | `false` | Set `"true"` if your Wi-Fi SSID is hidden. |
| `timer_finished_sound_file` | `sounds/gentle_timer.flac` (this repo) | The timer bell — a gentle two-tone bell (~-14 dBFS) replacing the more intense stock ring. Point at any FLAC/MP3 URL to change it (the other `*_sound_file` substitutions swap the stock chimes the same way). |
| `static_ip` / `gateway` / `subnet` / `dns1` / `dns2` | *(DHCP)* | Only with the static-IP stub (`esphome-builder.static-ip.yaml`) — pins a fixed LAN IP. |

Two firmware-side controls live in Home Assistant, not in YAML:

- **"Wake word" dropdown** — Hey Leonard / Hey Jarvis / Okay Nabu, switched at
  runtime, no reflash.
- **"Wake word sensitivity" select** — Slightly / Moderately / Very sensitive,
  applying the calibrated cutoffs above.
